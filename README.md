## Description
This application allows users to create professional, clean, elgant  READE.md files by answering a few questions, directly from the Terminal. 

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command(s):
Navigate to https://github.com/AussieKing/README-Constructor. Once there, opean a local Terminal (powershell, bash, terminal) on your locl machine.  From here, navigate to the desired folder where you'd like to copy the project (use cd method) and git clone the repository (' git clone https://github.com/AussieKing/README-Constructor.git ' )

## Usage
Run the program using your preferred code editing tool ( I use the terminal in VS Code). Answer the questions on the screen as they are provided to you in order to build your README file. Once all questions are answered, you'll find a README.md created, for you to use in your project. Note: if you make a mistake or want to change something in your file, you can still edit your README file later.
